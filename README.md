V0.0 Readme

Purpose of this library is 
1. fragmented development for differant vendors. MoLi is attempt to unify them.
i.e. Same SDK can be used for Ti Chip , NXP chip and Atmel Chip.
2. Code portablity. It is not implecete now a days. Code written for AVR if we need to port to ARM board.
It needs extra development efforts. but we write well abstracted code. 
code will be easy to port / or in best case will work on both architechture.
3. Toolchain managment and providing sample code out of box for perticular architecture.
